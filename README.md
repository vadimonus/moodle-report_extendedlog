Moodle plugin for extended log searching
========================================

Requirements
------------
- Moodle 3.5 (build 2018051700) or later.

Installation
------------
Copy the extendedlog folder into your Moodle /report directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Notice! Plugin versions 2.x will not work correctly on Moodle versions 3.5-3.7 if $CFG->cachejs=false.
That is common limitation for Moodle versions prior to 3.8, when working with ES6 modules,
required for Moodle 3.8 and later. Set $CFG->cachejs=true, or use version 1.x of plugin.

Usage
-----
This report is intended to be used only by the site administrator for investigation in number of cases, 
when standard log report does not allow to find the desired events. With this report you can easily do
following:

- Find out, who have granted role to user in some category a month ago
- List changes that were done on site by users from some IP or subnet
- Get events that happened in all courses in some category in one list
- Find failed logons for users using some email domain
- And so on

This report supports logstore_standart and logstore_database.

This report generates non-optimized db queries and may produce very high database load.
